# DeepModal

DeepModal is deeply integrated with Angular's reactivity system and extends the functionality of Angular Signals, allowing for more efficient and intuitive management of reactive data. It leverages Signals to enhance the reactive capabilities, while using a Proxy to monitor property access and updates, supporting nested objects and arrays. This ensures seamless reactivity even when dealing with complex data structures.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
